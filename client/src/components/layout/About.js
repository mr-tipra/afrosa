            <p>Our mission is to give students a headstart in the direction of their field of interest. What are the choices a student has after leaving the college? It isn’t a generic set of three things that everyone does.This is where Afrosa can help.

            Afrosa is a social platform which is designed to bridge the gap between the alumni and students. In the competitive world where everyone strives to perform their best, an aid from those who have “been there, done that” can give a notable boost to your career. This aid ranges from getting internships related to a certain job profile, job opportunities, awareness about the new technologies being explored in the corporate world and other countless benefits. Meanwhile, alumni could hire students as interns in their enterprise.
